# ROB-114 No-Audio Reward-Conditioned Mask LM

## Implementation

- Added `RewardConditionedMaskLMDataset` for saved ROB-109 UVQLM rollout
  `generation` tensors under `/store/store4/data/l2augment_rollout_uvqmlm`.
- Added `RewardConditionedMaskLM` collate logic that flattens sampled
  generations across rollout files and pads VQ sequences without audio fields.
- Added `RewardConditionedMaskLM`, a UVQLM-like no-audio mask LM conditioned by
  a bounded per-file reward scalar.
- Added full and smoke configs under
  `exp/configs/reward_conditioned_lm/no_audio_conditioning/`.

## Commands

Stats/model/augment smoke:

```bash
/store/store4/software/bin/anaconda3/envs/flash_attn_pytorch2/bin/python \
  exp/results/repro/reward_conditioned_lm/no_audio_conditioning/scripts/smoke_reward_conditioned_mask_lm.py
```

One-file training harness smoke:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" WANDB_MODE=disabled \
  /store/store4/software/bin/anaconda3/envs/flash_attn_pytorch2/bin/python \
  exp/train_freq_mask.py \
  --config exp/configs/reward_conditioned_lm/no_audio_conditioning/tedlium_per_utterance_smoke.yaml
```

Full training was not queued because ROB-114 explicitly requires no long GPU
training unless a later human comment asks for it.

## Validation

Completed on 2026-05-21.

- Stats smoke: 2 train rollout files and 2 dev rollout files loaded from the
  in-place ROB-109 rollout root. Bounded min-max and raw WER-delta rewards were
  finite for 20 train samples and 20 dev samples, with normalized ranges
  `[0.0, 1.0]` for both splits. Degenerate reward groups: 0 train, 0 dev.
- CPU model smoke: finite CE loss `7.714467525482178`, backward pass completed,
  and fixed-length generation at normalized rewards `0.0` and `1.0` produced
  exactly 7 VQ tokens each.
- One-recording augment smoke: real dev rollout
  `/store/store4/data/l2augment_rollout_uvqmlm/dev/AlGore_2009_0.pt` had
  1042 audio frames, audio-derived generation length 29, metadata generation
  length 29, 29 generated VQ tokens, mask shape `[1, 80, 1042]`, and augmented
  audio shape `[1, 80, 1042]`.
- One-file training harness smoke: W&B disabled, CPU device, 1 train file,
  1 dev file, one training batch. Initial dev loss `7.8133697509765625`, train
  batch loss `7.5905327796936035`, final averaged dev loss
  `7.81338095664978`, and both tmp
  and final smoke checkpoints saved.

Durable smoke artifacts:

- `exp/results/repro/reward_conditioned_lm/no_audio_conditioning/smoke/smoke_reward_conditioned_mask_lm.json`
- `exp/results/repro/reward_conditioned_lm/no_audio_conditioning/smoke/no_audio_reward_conditioned_mask_lm_smoke.pt`
- `exp/results/repro/reward_conditioned_lm/no_audio_conditioning/smoke/no_audio_reward_conditioned_mask_lm_smoke_tmp.pt`

The `.pt` checkpoint artifacts are intentionally ignored by Git.
