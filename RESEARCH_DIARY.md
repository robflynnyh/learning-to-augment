# Research Diary

Keep concise dated notes for project changes that future agents need in order to
reproduce results, interpret metrics, or avoid known failure modes.

## 2026-05-10

- Added Symphony project wiring for the Learn-to-Augment Linear project,
  including split instruction files, detached-job callbacks, wrapper templates,
  and a blocked follow-up issue helper.
- ROB-60 oracle result details live in `exp/results/repro/oracle/OUTCOME.md`;
  keep that file as the durable result summary rather than expanding diary
  notes. Generated plots/CSVs are beside it, and large screen/GPU logs remain
  uncommitted.
- Replaced the superseded ROB-62 `16384` / `9e-5` scaffold with the corrected
  result-repo setup under
  `exp/results/repro/policy/ROB-62_result_repo_2048_1epoch/`. This uses the
  mirrored Spotify 2048 checkpoint, `5e-6`, one evaluation epoch, RFM
  `FrequencyMaskingRanker`, and RMM `MixedMaskingRanker`; use
  `scripts/launch_rob62_result_repo_eval.sh` for the queued run.

## 2026-05-11

- Completed the ROB-62 corrected result-repo comparison on Mimas for TED-LIUM,
  Earnings-22, Rev16, and CHiME-6. Small result summaries and comparison tables
  are under `exp/results/repro/policy/ROB-62_result_repo_2048_1epoch/`; TAL
  remains missing because it was not mirrored on this host.
- Added ROB-71 grid-style config support via `exp/run_config_grid.py` and
  converted the repetitive oracle eval YAML fanout to `tedlium_grid.yaml`
  configs that materialize one-run YAMLs under ignored `.generated/`
  directories at launch time.
- Followed up ROB-71 by converting the remaining repro configs under
  `exp/results/repro/` to grid YAMLs and adding paired-case/product grid support
  for runs that sweep repeats over matched `lr` / `single_step_lr` settings.
- Added ROB-73 unconditional VQ mask LM sample rendering under
  `exp/results/repro/unconditional_lm/ROB-73_sample/`, using the trained UMLM
  and BVAE checkpoints cached from Stanage into the local Mimas checkpoint cache.
- Extended the ROB-73 render to 10 unconditional VQ mask LM samples with an
  overview grid, per-sample PNG/PDF masks, toy-spectrogram visualizations, and
  per-sample VQ-code metadata.
- Reorganized `exp/results/` for ROB-74: older reference artifacts now live
  under `exp/results/historical_results/`, while newer resumed-work outputs
  remain under `exp/results/repro/`. Treat the historical numbers as reference
  material until they are reverified.

## 2026-05-13

- Updated Symphony rules for ROB-83 to forbid `/tmp` on Mimas for working files,
  logs, downloads, result staging, callbacks, and experiment scratch space. Use
  durable repo-local paths, `exp/results/`, or suitable `/store/...` locations
  for artifacts that later Symphony turns may need to inspect.

## 2026-05-14

- Finalized ROB-60 oracle follow-ups across RMM, RFM, UVQLM, and RAN. Best
  completed segmented-test oracle result is RMM `lr=3e-5`, `search_lr=2e-1`,
  repeat 50 at `8.428%` WER; RAN peaks at repeat 5 with `8.885%` WER and
  remains weaker than the matching learned/random mask-search cells. Use
  `exp/results/repro/oracle/OUTCOME.md` plus `oracle_lr_sweep_vs_ufmr.{csv,pdf}`
  for the full table and plot.

## 2026-05-19

- Added the ROB-60 reduced plot
  `exp/results/repro/oracle/oracle_best_repeat50_lrs_vs_ufmr.{csv,pdf}` for
  the best repeat-50 LR setup per method, then refreshed both oracle plots with
  clearer styling. The reduced plot legend intentionally uses method-only
  labels; selected LR/search-LR details remain in `OUTCOME.md`.
